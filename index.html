                            <li><strong>Background:</strong>
                                <p>I was born in Australia to Australian parents with UK backgrounds. I have completed high school, certificates II to IV in Information Technology and some training in retail and frontline management. I have a connective tissue disorder which makes it easy for my joints to dislocate, so my hobbies are low impact activities including sewing and PC gaming.</p>

                    <h2>Interest</h2>
                </header>

                <h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>
                <p>I have always fount the concept of computer programming and communication fascinating; the way you can look at a working program and drill down to individual functions, and from there, lines of code, then to bits. All the tiny bits that can make up anything from the most banal calculator to your favourite MMO RPG or a bitcoin farm. I have envied people who can jump onto a Linux terminal and rattle off a few lines on the keyboard to access a file on a computer in some other location entirely, or use bash and vim to put together certificate chains that can even make an apple device happy to see it.</p>
                The turning point for me was when I had ruined my shoulder enough making pizzas that I couldn’t hold a cup of coffee without dislocating it, let alone a pizza shovel. My father offered assistance paying for surgery under the premise that I studied while I recovered. What can you study with one arm? I mean, probably a number of things, but I went with something I was interested in. I was stumped the moment I got to the computer at the local Tafe however, when it asked me to press Ctrl+Alt+Del to unlock, this is now something I count as a skill, along with reasonably fast one-handed touch typing.</p>
                I had planned on completing up to Diploma level but was offered my current job straight out of Certificate IV where I was to manage general upgrade of their PCs under a 6-month contract (this was five years ago now). Since then I have self-taught a whole heap of network admin, helpdesk, mobile device management and web development skills as well as accumulated a couple of subordinates</p>

                <h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
                <p>I have recently had a considerable amount of workload added and while I believe I can manage it, I think a pay rise would make things a bit better. As it stands however, formalisation of my training would go a long way to making my case. Where I am, there aren’t an awful lot of jobs as interesting as my current one, so I don’t want to lose it while I study. That’s where online study comes in, and RMIT seemed to offer the best choice for a study pathway I liked.</p>

                <span class="icon major style5 fa-gem"></span>
                <h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
                <p>Honestly, I don’t expect to learn anything specific in this particular course, perhaps some refinement of my existing self-taught skills, and maybe some interesting technologies I have not yet had the opportunity to expose myself to, like VR and AR. I hope to be surprised by some of the things I do learn.</p>

                <h3>A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.</h3>
                <p>This position is for a web developer will will be involved in maintaining a website and with both the design and the function of the website’s redesign.</p>
                I found a passion in developing websites, and full stack is all I have known. I really enjoy improving websites and often find myself imagining ways to ‘fix’ websites a come across, so getting paid to do this would be a bonus!.</p>
                They are also expecting tertiary qualification in Computer Science.</p>
                <h3>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</h3>
                <p>I have completed Certificates II and III in Information Digital Media and technology and certificate IV in Information Technology. I have developed and managed many websites in html, CSS and JavaScript, as well as using Business Catalyst, Joomla and WordPress. In terms of experience and skills, I have worked in information technology for five years working in a team as well as management with executive, service delivery and HR departments to provide support, develop documentation manage a network and to optimise systems. I am a diligent worker and strive for perfection in my outcomes.</p>
                <h3>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can.</h3>
                <p>At this point, I like to think that I am on my way to being suitable for such a job; I am doing website development work, and am gaining experience in the IT industry, I am even taking steps toward a degree in Computer Science. A plan for obtaining the skills qualifications and experience would be to continue with studies and branch out in the jobs that I take, potentially even moving to a capital city in order to broaden the opportunities. For example, joining a team that is working on back-end development, with NoSQL and/or Stripe.</p>

                <h3>The results of an online Myers-Briggs test.<h3>
									<p>Personality Style Test (based on Myers-Briggs) from <a href="https://www3.psychcentral.com/" target="_blank">https://www3.psychcentral.com/</a></p>
									<p><strong>ISTJ - The Duty Fulfiller</strong></p>
									<p>Serious and quiet, interested in security and peaceful living. Extremely thorough, responsible, and dependable. Well-developed powers of concentration. Usually interested in supporting and promoting traditions and establishments. Well-organized and hard working, they work steadily towards identified goals. They can usually accomplish any task once they have set their mind to it.</p>
									<h4>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h4>
									<p>These results suggest (and I agree) that I am a hard worker; I endeavour to complete all given tasks to a high standard.</p>
									<h4>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h4>
									<p>In a team, this can mean that I tend to take over without noticing it myself an have to remind myself to pull back a little and involve other members.</p>
									<h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
									<p>When forming a team, it helps to find people who are confident and can make sure that they also stay involved in the work. In these sorts of teams, I find the results are exceptional in most cases.</p>
								<h3>The results of an online learning style test.</h3>
                <p>Learning Style Test from <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/" target="_blank">http://www.educationplanner.org/</a></p>
                <p><strong>Your Scores:</strong>
                    <ul class="notd">
                        <li>Auditory: 50%</li>
                        <li>Visual: 25%</li>
                        <li>Tactile: 25%</li>
                    </ul>
                    You are an Auditory learner!</p>
                <span><strong>Auditory</strong></span>
                <p>If you are an auditory learner, you learn by hearing and listening. You understand and remember things you have heard. You store information by the way it sounds, and you have an easier time understanding spoken instructions than written ones. You often learn by reading out loud because you have to hear it or speak it in order to know it.</p>
                <p>As an auditory learner, you probably hum or talk to yourself or others if you become bored. People may think you are not paying attention, even though you may be hearing and understanding everything being said.</p>
                <p>Here are some things that auditory learners like you can do to learn better.
                    <ul class="notd">
                        <li>Sit where you can hear.</li>
                        <li>Have your hearing checked on a regular basis.</li>
                        <li>Use flashcards to learn new words; read them out loud.</li>
                        <li>Read stories, assignments, or directions out loud.</li>
                        <li>Record yourself spelling words and then listen to the recording.</li>
                        <li>Have test questions read to you out loud.</li>
                        <li>Study new material by reading it out loud.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Remember that you need to hear things, not just see things, in order to learn well.</p>
                <h4>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h4>
                <p>I understand from this that my learning style is mostly auditory which means that I learn best when I can hear the content involved. I think that this is why the Collaborate Ultra chats seem to work quite well for me. I don’t believe I struggle too much with visual or tactile learning though.</p>
                <h4>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h4>
                <p>In a team scenario, I think that I will benefit most from live audio chats, although it will probably be necessary to text chat a lot due to scheduling and distance.</p>
                <h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
                <p>I think it would make sense to involve group (audio) chat in our collaborations to account for this learning style. It would also be beneficial to have other members of the team who were auditory learners too for more effective teamwork.</p>
                <h3>The results of one further online test of your choosing</h3>
                <p>IPIP Big Five Factor Markers test from <a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/" target="_blank">https://openpsychometrics.org/</a></p>
                <img src="images\IPIP.png" alt="screenshot showing IPIP test results">
                <h4>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h4>
                <p>A rather obvious point in this on is the second percentile result in factor II which matches strongly with my Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder. This is something that I have been working on for my whole adult life and some of my teen-age life. All in all, I would agree with these results (I have done a lot of self-reflection so I think I make a good judge), and I think that as long as I have a clear goal to work towards, I make a pretty good worker.</p>
                <h4>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h4>
                <p>My extreme emotions can be difficult to handle, though with a clear goal I think I work well in a team setting. I can imagine creative solutions to all sorts or issue and get really involved in extrapolation ideas with other people.</p>
                <h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
                <p>In team scenarios I find it best to be open with people about my potential behaviour and to ask people to let me know if (when) they need me to stop. Apart from that I think that finding people with a strong work ethic and creative thinking skills will make for a good team.</p>

                    <h2>Project Ideas</h2>
                </header>
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>The project idea is to develop a website for end-users and admins using products with limited or poor support. A self-help/peer-help documentation repository and forum. The site would contain templates and instructions on setting up a how-to, and threads for different products and problems, along with statistics on people’s overall experience with products – is it worth it to keep going with it, or should you cut your losses?</p>
                It could be white-labelled for developers just setting out who don’t yet have their documentation processes up to scratch. Ideally, developers would not like to have their produce feature on such a site (hence “white-label”), but if they did, would be able to use it to gain insights into their users’ experiences.</p>
                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>In my job as inhouse IT at a local disability service provider, I work with a client management system, let’s call it “Trouble”.</p>
                Trouble is built for a niche market and is only targeted for Australian datasets. The product has grown in features and complexity to keep up with changing needs, however, the developers have poorly documented their changes or updated the manuals and haven’t tested thoroughly before release. We find the support team a nightmare to work with their go-to response being to blame us not doing it right. I found myself developing a manual for my end-users to use and considering selling it to the developers.</p>
                The support provided is sub-par, but the system is so very deeply embedded in the business that moving on would be almost catastrophic.
                </p>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>My team and I wonder at how other users of Trouble deal with their issues. Do they just work around the bugs? Do they get better support because they offer more revenue? We know why there’s no forums. The program is targeted at such a niche market, one that’s not generally into developing forums, and the system is sold directly to business through the developer, so there are no partners who may be in a position to get the ball rolling.</p>
                I would like to develop a website for a sort of self-help/peer-help site where businesses who could offer advice or solutions for issues in products with similar issues as Trouble. Where there should be better support and documentation, but there just isn’t.</p>
                The site would be a platform for collaborative assistance with documentation developed by the consumers of products; things like pesky environment settings that can break the whole program, or the best way to set up security settings so that your data is secure from inexperienced end users. It could be white-labelled for developers just setting out who don’t yet have their documentation processes up to scratch. Ideally, developers would not like to have their produce feature on such a site (hence “white-label”), but if they did, would be able to use it to gain insights into their users’ experiences and even into ways of using their products that they had not investigated.
                </p>

                <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
                <h3>Skills Required</h3>
                <p>The skills required would be full stack website development, i.e. html, css, php/js, databasing, maybe SQL, graphic design, testing, security. There would be need for experience with developing documentation, putting together forum type interactivity, developing templates, moderating posts.</p>
                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>If this project were to be successful, businesses feeling cornered by a product with poor support since so mush of their business involves is use would be able to seek support from consumers of the same product who may have experienced similar issues.</p>
                <p>From the other side, developers would have the opportunity to assess the experiences of their customers, or customers of competing companies and to improve upon their services and products accordingly. It would also be possible for developers of new products to quickly and easily get a functional support system for their users in place.</p>
